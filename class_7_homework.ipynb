    "# Synthetic Data Generation & Fine-Tuning (QLoRA) Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This week’s project involves creating a synthetic dataset and using it to fine-tune the model for better academic Q\\&A performance. The plan is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Sampling:** Select **100 academic papers** (e.g. using their abstracts and key sections). Ensure a diverse mix of subjects or paper types to provide a broad training base.\n",
    "2. **Synthetic Q\\&A Generation:** Use **GPT-4** to generate \\~5 question-answer pairs for each paper. Craft a prompt that provides GPT-4 with the paper’s abstract or content and asks for informative Q\\&A pairs. The questions should cover important points, definitions, or insights from the paper, and the answers should be correct summaries or explanations based on the text. This yields roughly **500 Q\\&A pairs** in total.\n",
    "3. **Include Edge-Case Examples:** Incorporate some **edge-case questions** among the above pairs – for example, a question that reflects a misunderstanding or a **hallucinated detail** about the paper. For these, provide an answer that corrects the false premise or clarifies that the paper doesn’t contain that information. Including a few such Q\\&A examples (e.g. *“Q: According to the paper, what is the value of constant XYZ?”* when XYZ is not actually in the paper, and *“A: The paper does not specify XYZ; in fact, that detail is not discussed.”*) will teach the model to handle incorrect or unanswerable queries gracefully.\n",
    "4. **Format Data for Instruction Tuning:** Convert all the Q\\&A pairs into the **instruction-tuning JSONL format** expected by our fine-tuning pipeline. Each line in the dataset should represent a complete prompt-response dialogue. We will use a chat-style format with explicit roles. For example, you can prepend a fixed system instruction (such as `\"You are a helpful academic assistant.\"`) and then format each Q\\&A as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   <|system|> You are a helpful academic Q&A assistant specialized in scholarly content.\n",
    "   <|user|> [Question from the dataset]\n",
    "   <|assistant|> [Answer from the dataset]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Structure each JSONL entry to contain this composite prompt. This ensures the model is trained in a conversational format where it receives a user question and produces an answer, following any system instructions (tone, style) you provided.\n",
    "5. **Fine-Tune LLaMA 3 7B with QLoRA:** Run a fine-tuning job on **Google Colab** (or a local GPU) using **QLoRA** via the Unsloth library. QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) will load the 7B model in 4-bit precision and train low-rank adaptation weights. This drastically lowers memory usage, allowing even a 7B (and larger) model to be fine-tuned on a single GPU without out-of-memory errors. Using Unsloth’s tools, load the base LLaMA 3 (7B) model (preferably an instruct variant) and fine-tune it on your synthetic Q\\&A dataset. We’ll use LoRA adapters so the base model weights remain fixed; the training will produce a small set of adapted weights after 1–3 epochs over the dataset. *(Expect the fine-tuning to be relatively fast given \\~500 examples — on a T4 or similar GPU, a few epochs should only take minutes.)*\n",
    "6. **Evaluation (Pre vs. Post-Tuning):** Finally, evaluate the model’s academic QA performance **before and after fine-tuning**. Prepare a set of **10 test questions** covering various papers or concepts (you can come up with these manually, ensuring they are challenging). Run the original base model and the fine-tuned model on each question, and compare the answers. Look for improvements such as: the fine-tuned model’s answers are more detailed, use terminology from the papers, correct mistakes the base model made, or cite relevant concepts from the training data. This comparison will let you quantify accuracy gains. You might measure accuracy as the number of questions answered correctly or with relevant info, or simply note qualitatively how the responses differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this design, the key idea is that **domain-aligned data** will make the model more knowledgeable in that domain. Instead of the agent relying solely on retrieval each time, the fine-tuned model will have *internalized* some academic knowledge and answer patterns. Fine-tuning on a well-structured QA dataset (as opposed to just dumping raw text) is crucial for the model to learn effectively."

      "\n",
      "**Market Impact:**\n",
      "Market impact refers to the effect of a large trade on the price of a security. When a significant order is executed, it can influence the market price, causing it to move away from its original level. This is because the trade can absorb a large portion of the available liquidity, leading to a temporary imbalance in supply and demand. As a result, the price may move against the trader, increasing the cost of the trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Slippage:**\n",
      "Slippage, on the other hand, is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. It is a measure of the price movement that occurs due to market impact, liquidity issues, or other market conditions. Slippage can be positive (in favor of the trader) or negative (against the trader), depending on the direction of the price movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate the difference:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Market impact: A large buy order is executed, causing the price to rise due to the increased demand.\n",
      "* Slippage: The trader expected to buy the security at $100, but due to market impact, the price rose to $105, resulting in a slippage of $5.\n",
      "\n",

      "Return autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation or autocorrelation, refers to the tendency of returns to be correlated with each other over time. In other words, if a security's return is high (or low) in one period, it is likely to be high (or low) in the next period as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Autocorrelation can significantly affect performance evaluation in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overestimation of returns**: If a security's returns are autocorrelated, it may appear to have a higher return than it actually does. This is because the autocorrelated returns are likely to be followed by similar returns, which can artificially inflate the security's average return.\n",
      "2. **Underestimation of risk**: Autocorrelated returns can also lead to an underestimation of risk. If a security's returns are autocorrelated, it may appear to be less volatile than it actually is, which can result in a lower estimated risk.\n",
      "3. **Incorrect ranking**: Autocorrelation can also affect the ranking of securities. If two securities have similar returns, but one has autocorrelated returns and the other does not, the autocorrelated security may appear to be more attractive than it actually is.\n",
      "4. **Incorrect calculation of Sharpe ratio**: The Sharpe ratio, which is a measure of risk-adjusted return, can be affected by autocorrelation. If a security's returns are autocorrelated, its Sharpe ratio may be artificially inflated, leading to incorrect conclusions about its performance.\n",

The goal is to achieve a consistent level of risk, rather than trying to time market movements or predict future returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Components:**\n",

      "1. **Volatility target**: A specific level of volatility (e.g., 10%, 15%, or 20%) that the portfolio aims to maintain.\n",

      "\n",
      "**When Volatility Targeting Can Improve Risk-Adjusted Returns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reduced drawdowns**: By maintaining a consistent volatility level, the portfolio is less likely to experience extreme drawdowns, which can improve overall performance.\n",
      "2. **Improved risk-adjusted returns**: By targeting a specific volatility level, the portfolio can achieve higher returns while maintaining a consistent level of risk, leading to improved risk-adjusted returns.\n",
      "3. **Increased diversification**: Volatility targeting can help maintain a diversified portfolio by adjusting the allocation to different assets or sectors to maintain the target volatility level.\n",

However, in bear markets, equal-weight portfolios may perform better due to their reduced exposure to the largest, most volatile stocks.\n",

      "\n",
      "In quantitative research, particularly in finance and investing, the terms in-sample, validation, and out-of-sample are crucial for evaluating the performance and robustness of a model. Here's a clear explanation of each:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **In-sample (IS)**: This refers to the data used to train and calibrate a model. The IS data is typically a subset of the total available data, and it's used to estimate the model's parameters, such as coefficients, weights, or other variables. The IS data is usually the largest portion of the total data, and it's used to optimize the model's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Validation (V)**: After training the model with the IS data, the next step is to validate its performance using a separate subset of data, known as the validation set. This set is usually smaller than the IS data and is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The validation set is used to assess the model's generalizability and robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Out-of-sample (OOS)**: This refers to the data that's not used in the training or validation process. The OOS data is typically the smallest portion of the total data and is used to evaluate the model's performance on completely new, unseen data. The OOS data is used to assess the model's ability to generalize and make predictions on data that's not part of the training or validation sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate the difference, consider a scenario where you're developing a trading strategy using historical stock prices. You might use the following data splits:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In-sample (IS): 80% of the data (e.g., 2015-2020)\n",
      "* Validation (V): 10% of the data (e.g., 2020-2021)\n",

      "In quant research, data is typically split into three subsets: in-sample (IS), validation (V), and out-of-sample (OOS). This helps evaluate model performance and generalizability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **In-Sample (IS)**: The largest subset, used to train and tune the model. It includes the majority of the data (e.g., 80-90%) and is used to estimate parameters, select features, and optimize hyperparameters. IS performance is often overly optimistic due to overfitting.\n",
      "2. **Validation (V)**: A smaller subset (e.g., 10-20%) used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data during training. It helps prevent overfitting by providing an early warning of potential issues. Validation metrics are often used to select the best model or hyperparameters.\n",
      "3. **Out-of-Sample (OOS)**: The smallest subset (e.g., 1-10%), used to evaluate the model's performance on completely new, unseen data. OOS performance is a more realistic indicator of the model's ability to generalize to real-world data. It's essential to ensure the OOS performance is comparable to the IS performance to avoid overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using these subsets, researchers can:\n",

      "\n",
      "Look-ahead bias, also known as data snooping or overfitting, is a common issue in backtesting that occurs when a model or strategy is optimized using data that is not available at the time of the investment decision. This means that the model is \"looking ahead\" to future data to make predictions or decisions, rather than relying on the available information at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you're backtesting a trading strategy that uses a moving average crossover to buy or sell a stock. You use historical data from 2010 to 2020 to optimize the strategy, including the moving average period and the buy/sell signals. However, when you test the strategy on the same data, you're essentially \"looking ahead\" to the future buy/sell signals that were used to optimize the strategy. This is not a realistic representation of how the strategy would perform in real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Consequences of Look-Ahead Bias:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Look-ahead bias can lead to overly optimistic results, as the model is essentially cheating by using future data to make decisions. This can result in:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Overfitting: The model becomes too specialized to the specific data used to optimize it, rather than generalizing to new, unseen data.\n",
      "2. Unrealistic expectations: The model's performance may not be replicable in real life, leading to disappointment and frustration.\n",
      "3. Poor decision-making: The model's reliance on future data can lead to poor investment decisions, as the model is not making decisions based on available information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Avoid Look-Ahead Bias:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid look-ahead bias, follow these best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use walk-forward optimization**: Split your data into training and testing sets, and optimize your model on the training set. Then, test the model on the testing set to evaluate its performance.\n",

This means the model is \"looking ahead\" to future data, which is not possible in real-world trading. Look-ahead bias can lead to overly optimistic results and poor out-of-sample performance.\n",

      "1. **More informative**: ES provides a better understanding of the potential losses beyond the VaR threshold, which is essential for risk management and capital allocation decisions.\n",
      "2. **Better for tail risk**: ES is more sensitive to extreme events, making it a better choice for capturing tail risk and systemic risk.\n",
      "3. **More robust**: ES is less sensitive to outliers and extreme values, which can lead to more accurate risk assessments.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Overfitting**: The model may be too complex and is fitting the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, it performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
      "2. **Imbalanced data**: If the classes in the data are imbalanced (e.g., one class has a much larger number of instances than the other), the model may be biased towards the majority class, leading to poor calibration.\n",
      "3. **Non-linear relationships**: The relationship between the features and the target variable may be non-linear, and the model may not be able to capture these relationships accurately.\n",
      "4. **High variance**: The model may be highly variable, meaning that small changes in the data or the model's parameters can result in large changes in the predictions.\n",
      "5. **Lack of regularization**: The model may not be regularized enough, leading to overfitting and poor calibration.\n",
      "6. **Insufficient data**: The model may not have enough data to learn from, leading to poor calibration.\n",
      "7. **Model selection**: The model may not be the best choice for the problem, or the hyperparameters may not be tuned correctly.\n",

      "\n",
      "A high Sharpe ratio can be misleading in small samples because it is sensitive to the volatility of the sample period. In small samples, the ratio of excess returns to volatility (Sharpe ratio) can be skewed by a single event or a short-term market fluctuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main reasons for this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Noise**: Small samples are more susceptible to noise, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of volatility and returns. This noise can cause the Sharpe ratio to be artificially high or low, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n",
      "2. **Sampling error**: The Sharpe ratio is a sample statistic, and like all sample statistics, it is subject to sampling error. In small samples, the sampling error can be large, leading to a high Sharpe ratio that may not reflect the true underlying performance of the investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, it's essential to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use larger samples**: If possible, use longer time periods or more data points to reduce the impact of noise and sampling error.\n",
      "2. **Consider the confidence interval**: Calculate the confidence interval for the Sharpe ratio to understand the uncertainty surrounding the estimate.\n",
      "3. **Compare to benchmarks**: Compare the Sharpe ratio to that of a benchmark or a peer group to put it into context.\n",
      "4. **Use other metrics**: Consider using other metrics, such as the Sortino ratio or the Calmar ratio, which are less sensitive to volatility and may provide a more accurate picture of investment performance.\n",

      "--- ORIGINAL ANSWER --------------------------------------------------\n",
      "**What is Look-Ahead Bias in Backtesting?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Look-ahead bias, also known as data snooping or overfitting, is a common issue in backtesting that occurs when a model or strategy is optimized using data that is not available at the time of the investment decision. This means that the model is \"looking ahead\" to future data to make predictions or decisions, rather than relying on the available information at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you're backtesting a trading strategy that uses a moving average crossover to buy or sell a stock. You use historical data from 2010 to 2020 to optimize the strategy, including the moving average period and the buy/sell signals. However, when you test the strategy on the same data, you're essentially \"looking ahead\" to the future buy/sell signals that were used to optimize the strategy. This is not a realistic representation of how the strategy would perform in real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Consequences of Look-Ahead Bias:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Look-ahead bias can lead to overly optimistic results, as the model is essentially cheating by using future data to make decisions. This can result in:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Overfitting: The model becomes too specialized to the specific data used to optimize it, rather than generalizing to new, unseen data.\n",
      "2. Unrealistic expectations: The model's performance may not be replicable in real life, leading to disappointment and frustration.\n",
      "3. Poor decision-making: The model's reliance on future data can lead to poor investment decisions, as the model is not making decisions based on available information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Avoid Look-Ahead Bias:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid look-ahead bias, follow these best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use walk-forward optimization**: Split your data into training and testing sets, and optimize your model on the training set. Then, test the model on the testing set to evaluate its performance.\n",

      "\n",
      "Look-ahead bias is a common issue in backtesting that occurs when a model uses information available after a trade has been executed to make decisions. This means the model is \"looking ahead\" to future data, which is not possible in real-world trading. Look-ahead bias can lead to overly optimistic results and poor out-of-sample performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of look-ahead bias:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using future data to set parameters**: If a model uses future data to determine optimal parameters, such as a moving average length or a threshold, it will not generalize well to new data.\n",
      "2. **Including post-trade data in the training set**: If a model is trained on data that includes the outcome of the trade (e.g., a buy signal followed by a price increase), it will not be able to replicate the same performance in real-world trading.\n",
      "3. **Using real-time data to make decisions**: If a model uses real-time data to make decisions, it will not be able to replicate the same performance in backtesting, where data is typically available at a slower pace.\n",

      "**How to avoid look-ahead bias:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use only in-sample data**: Train the model on data available up to the point of the trade, and use only in-sample data to make decisions.\n",
      "2. **Use walk-forward optimization**: Train the model on a subset of the data, and then test it on a subsequent subset. This process is repeated, with the model being re-trained on the next subset after each test.\n",
      "3. **Use a fixed, pre-determined strategy**: Define a strategy based on historical data, and then test it on new data without adjusting the parameters.\n",

      "**Equity Datasets:**\n",

      "In the context of equity datasets, survivorship bias occurs when only the surviving companies (those that have not gone bankrupt or been acquired) are included in the analysis, while the companies that have failed or been acquired are excluded.

      "For example, consider a study of stock performance that includes only companies listed at the end of the sample period. If a company was listed at the beginning of the sample but delisted later, its performance data will be missing, creating a biased sample.

      "A model with high AUC (Area Under the Curve) but poor calibration is a common issue in machine learning and predictive modeling. Here are some reasons why this might occur:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overfitting**: The model may be too complex and is fitting the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, it performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
      "2. **Imbalanced data**: If the classes in the data are imbalanced (e.g., one class has a much larger number of instances than the other), the model may be biased towards the majority class, leading to poor calibration.\n",
      "3. **Non-linear relationships**: The relationship between the features and the target variable may be non-linear, and the model may not be able to capture these relationships accurately.\n",
      "4. **High variance**: The model may be highly variable, meaning that small changes in the data or the model's parameters can result in large changes in the predictions.\n",
      "5. **Lack of regularization**: The model may not be regularized enough, leading to overfitting and poor calibration.\n",
      "6. **Insufficient data**: The model may not have enough data to learn from, leading to poor calibration.\n",
      "7. **Model selection**: The model may not be the best choice for the problem, or the hyperparameters may not be tuned correctly.\n",

      "To address these issues, you can try the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regularization**: Add regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping, to prevent overfitting.\n",
      "2. **Data preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to handle imbalanced classes, missing values, or outliers.\n",

      "A high Sharpe ratio can be misleading in small samples because it is sensitive to the volatility of the sample period. In small samples, the ratio of excess returns to volatility (Sharpe ratio) can be skewed by a single event or a short-term market fluctuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main reasons for this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Noise**: Small samples are more susceptible to noise, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of volatility and returns. This noise can cause the Sharpe ratio to be artificially high or low, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n",
      "2. **Sampling error**: The Sharpe ratio is a sample statistic, and like all sample statistics, it is subject to sampling error. In small samples, the sampling error can be large, leading to a high Sharpe ratio that may not reflect the true underlying performance of the investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, it's essential to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use larger samples**: If possible, use longer time periods or more data points to reduce the impact of noise and sampling error.\n",
      "2. **Consider the confidence interval**: Calculate the confidence interval for the Sharpe ratio to understand the uncertainty surrounding the estimate.\n",
      "3. **Compare to benchmarks**: Compare the Sharpe ratio to that of a benchmark or a peer group to put it into context.\n",
      "4. **Use other metrics**: Consider using other metrics, such as the Sortino ratio or the Calmar ratio, which are less sensitive to volatility and may provide a more accurate picture of investment performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By being aware of these limitations, investors and analysts can make more informed decisions when interpreting the Sharpe ratio in small samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- QLORA ANSWER --------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A high Sharpe ratio in small samples can be misleading due to the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Noise and sampling error**: Small samples are more susceptible to noise and sampling error, which can lead to overestimation of returns and underestimation of volatility. This can result in an artificially high Sharpe ratio.\n",
      "2. **Volatility clustering**: Small samples may not capture the full range of volatility, leading to an underestimation of volatility and an overestimation of the Sharpe ratio.\n",
      "3. **Non-stationarity**: Small samples may not be representative of the underlying process, and the Sharpe ratio may not be a reliable measure of risk-adjusted performance.\n",
      "4. **Overfitting**: Small samples can lead to overfitting, where the model is too closely tied to the specific data and does not generalize well to new data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, it's essential to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Increase the sample size**: Larger samples provide a more robust estimate of the Sharpe ratio.\n",
      "2. **Use robust estimation methods**: Techniques like the median Sharpe ratio or the rolling Sharpe ratio can be more robust to noise and sampling error.\n",
      "3. **Consider alternative metrics**: Other metrics, such as the Sortino ratio or the Omega ratio, may be more suitable for small samples.\n",
      "4. **Use out-of-sample validation**: Validate the Sharpe ratio on a separate, unseen dataset to ensure it generalizes well.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- DPO ANSWER --------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A high Sharpe ratio in small samples can be misleading due to the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Volatility clustering**: Small samples tend to capture periods of high volatility, which can inflate the Sharpe ratio. This can lead to overestimation of the strategy's risk-adjusted returns.\n",
      "2. **Sampling error**: Small samples are more susceptible to sampling error, which can result in an overestimation of the true Sharpe ratio. As the sample size increases, the sampling error decreases, and the Sharpe ratio becomes more reliable.\n",
      "3. **Data mining bias**: Small samples can lead to data mining bias, where the strategy's performance is optimized to the specific data set used. This can result in an overestimation of the strategy's Sharpe ratio.\n",
      "4. **Overfitting**: Small samples can lead to overfitting, where the strategy is too closely tailored to the specific data set used, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",
      "5. **Survivorship bias**: Small samples may not capture the full range of possible outcomes, including those that led to the strategy's elimination (e.g., due to poor performance or liquidity issues).\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, it's essential to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use larger sample sizes to reduce sampling error and increase the reliability of the Sharpe ratio.\n",
      "* Implement robustness checks, such as bootstrapping or Monte Carlo simulations, to assess the strategy's performance under different scenarios.\n",
      "* Consider using alternative risk-adjusted metrics, such as the Sortino ratio or the Omega ratio, which are less sensitive to volatility clustering.\n",
      "* Ensure that the sample is representative of the full range of possible outcomes, including those that led to the strategy's elimination.\n",
